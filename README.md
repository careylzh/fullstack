# fullstack
All concepts I felt I need to be "really good" at full stack swe

Like building my own log/syllabus of skills required to build a full stack app (systems design esp, maybe granular FE skills too. Anything la, can reorg proj struc ltr after a few months, or when the epihanic desire to do so arises)

## Preliminary intuitions
- one folder one proj with readme
- learning process: watch bite-sized content(cumulatively only 1hr or so) like linkedinLearning (eg. starting with auth) --> implement a mini-proj on the feature --> deploy/docs
